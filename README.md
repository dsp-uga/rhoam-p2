<p>Much of the power of AI today comes from the use of data-driven deep learning to train increasingly accurate models by using growing amounts of data. However, the strength of these techniques can also be a weakness. The AI systems learn what they’re taught, and if they are not taught with robust and diverse datasets, accuracy and fairness could be at risk.</p><br><br>
<p>The challenge in training AI is manifested in a very apparent and profound way with facial recognition technology. There can be difficulties in making facial recognition systems that meet fairness expectations.The heart of the problem is not with the AI technology itself, per se, but with how the AI-powered facial recognition systems are trained. For the facial recognition systems to perform as desired – and the outcomes to become increasingly accurate –  training data must be diverse and offer a breadth of coverage</p>

<p>Team has gone through many research paper while formulating the solution to the problem. Please refere [Understanding Data](https://github.com/dsp-uga/rhoam-p2/wiki/Understanding-Data) for more reference.</p><br><br>

<p> To deal with the Ethics of the data we have also created a Ethics Checklist and answered all the Ethics questions on our Ethics wiki page. Please visit
